Cassandra CQL3 client for Clojure wrapping [datastax/java-driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver).

!! Early release, [datastax/java-driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver) is still not published on maven and in active developpement.

## But why yet another one?

You would think I'd get bored of cassandra clients, but
[datastax/java-driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver) looks
very promising.

It's built on top of the new binary protocol, can handle all the
pooling/balancing/failover for you, is very active, has synchronous and
asynchronous APIs, is likely to become the standard client for java
(it's the only one I know that use the new protocol) and you can trust
[datastax](http://datastax.com/) people to improve and maintain it.

Their driver is very complete, alia's code without the tests is around
200 lines.

Thrift clients are still very relevant though, CQL3 brings a lot of
high level features, but for now it still feels incomplete on some
aspects.

If you want a Thrift based client for Clojure you could give a try to [casyn](https://github.com/mpenet/casyn)

## What Alia can do and cannot do but will do in the future

It's relatively low level for now, but it's quite complete, very
reliable and stable.

### Can do

* Nice simple api to work with string queries or prepared statements,
  sync/async (using regular functions, promises or callbacks depending
  on the mode you choose), with transparent handling of clojure
  datatypes (all cassandra data types are supported).

* The exposed parts of the public api all allow full access to
  java-driver API if you need to leverage some of the advanced
  functionalities it provides (that is until I provide some wrappers
  around that).

### Will do soon

* Query generation from a cute korma'ish dsl.
* Support for more external lib data types (joda time is already supported)
* More sugar around retry/pooling/balancing options
* Proper documentation

## Show me some code!

First some [API docs](http://mpenet.github.com/alia).

```clojure

(require '[qbits.alia :as alia] )

(def cluster (alia/cluster "localhost"))

;; sessions are separate so that you can interact with multiple
;; keyspaces from the same cluster definition
(def session (alia/connect cluster))

(alia/execute session "CREATE KEYSPACE alia
                       WITH replication = {'class': 'SimpleStrategy', 'replication_factor' : 3};")

;; every function that requires session as first argument can be also
;; used without this argument if you provide a binding (valid for alia/execute, alia/prepare, alia/bind):

(alia/with-session session
   (alia/execute "USE alia;")
   (alia/execute "CREATE TABLE users (user_name varchar,
                                     first_name varchar,
                                     last_name varchar,
                                     auuid uuid,
                                     birth_year bigint,
                                     created timestamp,
                                     valid boolean,
                                     emails set<text>,
                                     tags list<bigint>,
                                     amap map<varchar, bigint>,
                                     PRIMARY KEY (user_name));")
  (alia/execute "INSERT INTO users
                 (user_name, first_name, last_name, emails, birth_year, amap, tags, auuid,valid)
                 VALUES('frodo', 'Frodo', 'Baggins',
                 {'f@baggins.com', 'baggins@gmail.com'}, 1,
                 {'foo': 1, 'bar': 2}, [4, 5, 6],
                 '1f84b56b-5481-4ee4-8236-8a3831ee5892', true);")

  (def prepared-statement (alia/prepare "select * from users where user_name=?;"))
  (-> prepared-statement
      (alia/bind "mpenet") ;; if you have more args: (alia/bind "foo" "bar" 1 (java.util.Date.)) etc...
      alia/execute)
  >> [[{:name "user_name", :value "frodo"}
       {:name "first_name", :value "Frodo"}
       {:name "last_name", :value "Baggins"}
       {:name "birth_year", :value 1}
       {:name "created" :value nil}
       {:name "valid" :value true}
       {:name "emails", :value #{"baggins@gmail.com" "f@baggins.com"}}

       {:name "tags" :value [4 5 6]}
       {:name "auuid" :value #uuid "1f84b56b-5481-4ee4-8236-8a3831ee5892"}]]

  ;; if you prefer array-maps:
  (-> prepared-statement
      (alia/bind "mpenet")
      alia/execute
      alia/rows->map-coll)

  >> ({"created" nil,
       "last_name" "Baggins",
       "emails" #{"baggins@gmail.com" "f@baggins.com"},
       "tags" [4 5 6],
       "first_name" "Frodo",

       "auuid" #uuid "1f84b56b-5481-4ee4-8236-8a3831ee5892",
       "valid" true,
       "birth_year" 1,
       "user_name" "frodo"})

  ;; asynchronous interface

  ;; via a clojure promise
  (def result (alia/execute "select * from users;" :async? true))

  ;; blocks until realized
  @result

  ;; or using success/error handlers (it still returns a promise just like before)
  (alia/execute "select * from users;"
                :success (fn [r] (do-something-with-result r)
                :error (fn [e] (print "fail!"))))
) ;; binding

;; cleanup
(shutdown session)
(shutdown cluster)

```


## Installation

You need to install
[datastax/java-driver](https://github.com/datastax/java-driver)
manually until it gets publised (it is still in developpement).

```bash
git clone git@github.com:datastax/java-driver.git
cd driver-core
mvn install -DskipTests
```

Then add this to your dependencies:

```clojure
[cc.qbits/alia "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```
